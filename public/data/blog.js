          <h2>The Bad: Pitfalls to Avoid</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Lack of Alignment: A major pitfall is developing an IT strategy
              that operates in isolation from the organization's goals. Without
              proper alignment, the strategy may lead to wasted resources and
              missed opportunities.
            </li>
            <li>
              Short-Term Focus: A myopic IT strategy that only addresses
              immediate needs without considering long-term goals can hinder
              sustainable growth and lead to costly overhauls down the line.
            </li>
            <li>
              Overcomplicating the Plan: Complex strategies might seem
              impressive on paper, but they can create confusion and
              inefficiency when put into practice. Simplicity and clarity are
              essential for successful execution.
            </li>
            <li>
              Ignoring User Experience: Neglecting user experience can be
              detrimental to the organization. Whether it's employees or
              customers, their satisfaction and productivity depend on IT
              systems that are user-friendly and intuitive.
            </li>
            <li>
              Lack of Regular Evaluation: An IT strategy must be continuously
              evaluated and adjusted as needed. Failing to monitor progress and
              make necessary improvements can result in missed opportunities and
              outdated solutions.

              cybersecurity risks can result in data breaches, damaging the
              company's reputation and leading to legal and financial
              repercussions.

              unforeseen expenses, cost overruns, and budget mismanagement,
              impacting the organization's bottom line.
            </li>
            <li>
              Employee Frustration: If an IT strategy doesn't meet employee
              needs or creates more hurdles than benefits, it can lead to
              frustration, decreased productivity, and even employee turnover.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>
